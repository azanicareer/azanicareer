### Code Explanation

```python
!apt-get install poppler-utils
!pip install pdf2image
```

These lines are shell commands using the exclamation mark (!) to run in a Jupyter Notebook or similar environments. The first command installs the `poppler-utils` package, which includes utilities for working with PDF files. The second command installs the `pdf2image` Python package, which can be used to convert PDF pages to images.

```python
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
```

This line imports the `convert_from_path` function from the `pdf2image` package. This function allows you to convert pages from a PDF document into images.

```python
import requests
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from skimage.io import imread
from skimage.transform import resize
```

These lines import various Python libraries and modules:

- `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests to fetch an image from a URL.
- `matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: Used for plotting and displaying images.
- `numpy as np`: Imports the NumPy library, often used for numerical operations.
- `imread` and `resize` functions from the `skimage.io` and `skimage.transform` modules, respectively. These are used for reading and resizing images.

```python
url = 'https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jiji.jpg'
```

This line defines a URL pointing to an image. The code will fetch this image from the internet.

```python
im = imread(url)
```

This line fetches an image from the specified URL using the `imread` function and stores it in the variable `im`. The image is loaded as a NumPy array.

```python
plt.imshow(im);
```

This line displays the image stored in the variable `im` using Matplotlib's `imshow` function. The semicolon (;) is often used in Jupyter Notebooks to suppress unnecessary output.

```python
im = resize(im, (512, 512))
```

This line resizes the image stored in the variable `im` to a size of 512x512 pixels using the `resize` function from the scikit-image library.

```python
plt.imshow(im);
```

Finally, this line displays the resized image using Matplotlib's `imshow` function.

This code fetches an image from a URL, displays it, resizes it, and then displays the resized version. It also includes some package installations at the beginning to set up the required libraries for working with PDFs and images.
